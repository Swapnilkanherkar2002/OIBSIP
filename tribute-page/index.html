        <!-- Information About This Person -->
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Ka(15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served
           as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence 
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved
             in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man 
             of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal 
             organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
              nuclear test by India in 1974.
